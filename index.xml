<!--=======================================================================================================================
An <index/> element represents a ReaPack repository.  That is, it represents a repository that can be imported into
ReaPack's "Manage repositories" window inside REAPER.

    <index
        version=""  Must be 1.
        name=""     The value that will show up under the "Name" column in ReaPack's "Manage repositories" window once this "index.xml" file has been imported.
        />
    
A ReaPack repository can contain one or more ReaPack packages.  Every package is declared using a <reapack/>
element, and each of these elements must be placed under a <category/> element.  The category element
is used for organizational purposes when the package is listed in ReaPack's "Browse packages" window.

    <category
        name=""      Specifies the string that will be displayed under the "Category" column when the package
        >            is listed in ReaPack's "Browse packages" window.
        <reapack
            name=""  Specifies the name of the package, as it should be displayed under the "Package"
                     column when the package is listed in ReaPack's "Browse packages" window.
                         
            type=""  Specifies the type of content that is found inside the package.  Valid types are:
        />           [script/effect/extension/data/theme/langpack/webinterface/projectpl/tracktpl/midinotenames/autoitem].
    </category>
    
Every ReaPack package has one or more versions associated with it, each declared using a <version/> child
element.  Inside each version element, the individual files that are part of the package at that version are
then declared using <source/> elements.  Inside ReaPack's "Browse packages" window, each listed package has a
"Version" item in its context menu.  So the <version/> elements declare the set of version number items that
will appear under the "Version" item's submenu when the user navigates into it.  When the user chooses a
version and applies it, only the files declared for that version will be imported into REAPER from the package.

    <version
        name="x.x.x"     (Required) The version number.
        author=""        (Required) The author associated with this version.
        time=""          (Optional) The time at which this version of the package is considered to have been created (must be ISO 8601 format).
        >
        <source
            file=""      (Optional) File path that the file should be written to when installed.  By default,
                                    files are laid out in the following way when the "file" attribute is omitted:
                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                                      <REAPER>\               REAPER's %AppData% folder.
                                        <reapack_type>\       REAPER %AppData% folder subdirectory that is associated with the <repack/>'s declared type (e.g. "scripts" -> "Scripts\").
                                          <reapack_name>\     Folder given the same name as the <repack/>.
                                            <category_name>\  Folder given the same name as the <repack/>'s parent <category/>.
                                              [file_name]     The name of the file pointed to by the specified URL.
                                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                                    If the <repack/> element is given a name that contains special characters that
                                    aren't allowed in file names, then the "file" attribute MUST be specified for
                                    EACH declared file.  Otherwise, this will lead to a package installation error.
                
            platform=""  (Optional) The platform that the file is applicable to.  Possible values are:
                                    [all (default), darwin, darwin32, darwin64, darwin-arm64 (v1.2.3.1+), linux, linux32,
                                     linux64, linux-armv7l (v1.2.3+), linux-aarch64 (v1.2.3+), windows, win32 and win64]
            type=""      (Optional) Overrides the type declared by the package.
                
            main=""      (Optional) List of Action List sections separated by spaces.  Only effective on script files.  Possible values are:
                                    [main, midi_editor, midi_inlineeditor, midi_eventlisteditor, mediaexplorer].
                                    (For compatibility with v1.0, a special value true is also supported. This uses the category name to determine the section.)
                
            hash==""     (Optional) Multihash checksum of the file in hexadecimal form (added in v1.2.2).  Supports SHA-256 (1220 prefix).
            >
            URL          (Required) URL to a GitHub repository file at a specific commit ID.
